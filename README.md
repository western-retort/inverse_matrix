# inverse_matrix
An inverse matrix solver in c++ . Can solve till 3x3 matrix
The program was made keeping the fact in mind that in future i might want to increase it to solve 4x4 5x5 and so on . 
The program will read the matrix from writer.txt file so write the matrix in that file .
FORMATTING IN writer.txt is important . Each element in the row to be seperated by a space . Any mistake (even an invisible extra space) will mean that the code wont run .
The program can detect the dimension ie 2x2 , 3x3 of the file and perform operations on it directyl . 
Answer will be written directly into the writer.txt file

NOTE : THIS PROGRAM CAN ONLY SOLVE A 2D MATRIX . thankyou :)
